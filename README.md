Welcome to MyLaTeX_Gallery
=============================
This term, I wrote a lot of `LaTeX` code
to get the jobs done. Here is the collections
of them that I take most pride of. You can wander around
and get inspiration and give me feedback! Your enhancement
is the best prize for my efforts to share all these!

Languange
=========
Currently all the documents are Chinese-only. But all the README's
are in English.

How Does It Work
================
Well, I covered many typical constructs of `LaTeX` in these projects
so reading them may give you idea of how they work. They are also
good starting points for a new project. The content of the papers
are not very relevant on this aspect but they are just scientific
articles so won't hurt.

Requirements
============
There are only figures and `tex` code around. No pre-built `pdf`
so you need to build them but that won't be an issue for a skilfull
user like you, auh! In Chinese, I'd respect you as an **Old Driver**, auh!
Anyway, here are the requirements you must meet.

- OS is better to be Ubuntu-16.04. I only have one and perfectly one computer
with one and perfectly one OS on it.

- [Texlive distribution][1]. MikTex or others are not tested. Ports are welcome!
- [CTeX][2]. The **C**hinese **Tex** Package. Mostly comes with texlive.

Here is the requirements you're recommended to meet.
- [Vimtex][3]. A Vim plugin that makes your tex life a heaven.

Self Promotion
