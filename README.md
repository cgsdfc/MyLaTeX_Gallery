Welcome to MyLaTeX_Gallery
=============================
This term (2018 spring, Beihang University), I wrote a lot of `LaTeX` code
to get my homeworks done. Here is the collections
of them that I'd take most pride of and want to share with you.
You can wander around and get inspiration and use them for your projects.
You are free to use them.
You can give me feedbacks with Issue and Pull Request.

Languange
=========
Currently all the documents are in Chinese-only.
All the README's are in English.

How Does It Work
================
Well, I covered many typical constructs of `LaTeX` in these projects
so reading them may give you idea of how they work. They are also
good starting points for a new project. The contents of the papers
are not very relevant on this aspect but they are just scientific
articles and you can delete them if you wish.
Besides, I drew most of the figures using
[inkscape][4] (I download some of them from the Internet) so you may
modify them to suit you needs (remember to quote the original authors
of the figures from paper though. you don't need to quote me).

Requirements
============
There are only figures and `tex` code around. No pre-built `pdf` currently
so you need to build them but that won't be an issue for a skilfull
user like you, auh! In Chinese, I'd respect you as an **Old Driver**, auh!
Anyway, here are the requirements you must meet.

- OS is better to be Ubuntu-16.04. I only have one and perfectly one computer
with one and perfectly one OS on it so that is the only platform I tested.

- [Texlive distribution][1]. MikTex or others are not tested. Ports are welcome!
- [CTeX][2]. The **C**hinese **TeX** Package. Mostly comes with texlive.

Here is the requirements you're recommended to meet.
- [Vimtex][3]. A Vim plugin that makes your tex life a heaven.
- [Inkscape][4]. You can view and modify the `.svg` figures wtih it.
- Chinese. It is a wonderful language. Go ahead and learn it!

Lisence
